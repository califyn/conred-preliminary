Here is my code for ConRED, a **con**trastive **R**NA-**e**xpression and pathological **d**iagnosis matcher.

Preliminary results were submitted to the Regeneron Science Talent Search.
Research is ongoing.

Code is primarily in these three files (all in the ``code`` directory):
- ``train.py`` for actual training code
- ``datasets.py`` for dataset/data-utils generation
- ``model.py`` for initializing custom models
Data is not in this repository as it's a few gigabytes too big.

Also, scripts for generating figures are in ``figures_script.py``.
